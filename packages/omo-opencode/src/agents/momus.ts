/**
 * Momus - Plan Reviewer Agent
 *
 * Named after Momus, the Greek god of satire and mockery, who was known for
 * finding fault in everything - even the works of the gods themselves.
 * He criticized Aphrodite (found her sandals squeaky), Hephaestus (said man
 * should have windows in his chest to see thoughts), and Athena (her house
 * should be on wheels to move from bad neighbors).
 *
 * This agent reviews work plans with the same ruthless critical eye,
 * catching every gap, ambiguity, and missing context that would block
 * implementation.
